## Requirements
* Xcode 4.6 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC

If you are not using ARC in your project, add `-fobjc-arc` as a compiler flag for all the files in this project.

## Demo

Build and run the `RETrimControlExample` project in Xcode to see `RETrimControl` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `RETrimControl` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.15.2** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add RETrimControl:

``` bash
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'RETrimControl', '~> 1.2'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `RETrimControl` files into your project, and add `#include "RETrimControl.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
RETrimControl *trimControl = [[RETrimControl alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, (self.view.frame.size.height - 28) / 2.0f, 300, 28)];
trimControl.length = 200; // 200 seconds
trimControl.delegate = self;
[self.view addSubview:trimControl];
```

You may want to to set your controller to conform to `RETrimControlDelegate` protocol to receive notifications when values are being changed.

``` objective-c
...
trimControl.delegate = self;
...
```

``` objective-c
- (void)trimControl:(RETrimControl *)trimControl didChangeLeftValue:(CGFloat)leftValue rightValue:(CGFloat)rightValue
{
    NSLog(@"Left = %f, right = %f", leftValue, rightValue);
}
```

## Customization

You can assign your custom resource bundle on control initialization:

``` objective-c
RETrimControl *trimControl = [[RETrimControl alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 300, 28) resourceBundle:@"CustomResources.bundle"];
```
